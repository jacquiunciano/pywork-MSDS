# Section 1: Analysis Report
## Introduction
This report explores the relationship between the 4C of diamonds (cut, carat, color, 
and clarity) and the price of the diamond. In addition, a simple linear regression 
analysis is done in order to determine if carat weight and price have a linear 
relationship. The data set is provided by the certified diamond retailer company, 
**Blue Nile**. Their diamonds are analysed and graded by the Gemological Institute 
of America (GIA) which is one of the most reputable diamond labs.

## Findings Between the 4Cs and Price 
After analysing the relationship between the 4Cs and the price of the diamonds, 
there is strong evidence that the carat weight is the largest influencer in determining 
the price of a diamond. The other three factors will need more in depth analysis in 
order to determine their statistical significance as slight differences between the 
cut, clarity, and color grade and the price were noted. **Blue  Nile** has explained 
that while the quality of a diamond is determined by a balance of the carat weight, 
clarity grade, color grade, and cut grade, the price can mostly be influenced by 
the carat weight due to media and adverts. 

However, they have also stated that the cut can be the biggest factor in the price 
of a diamond, rather than the carat weight. While the data set provided by **Blue Nile** 
definitely has some very high quality cuts of diamonds with a more expensive price 
tag, it is noted that for the most part, the price does not visually seem to be too 
different between the different grades of diamond cuts, suggesting more in-depth 
analysis should be done. 

In terms of the color and clarity of a diamond, **Blue Nile** has stated that while 
these variables can influence the price of a diamond, there are other factors that 
affect the appearance of the variables. For example, the metal used for a setting 
can impact the appearance of the color. The size and shape of the diamond can mask 
the inclusions or make the inclusions more visible. This is mostly supported by the 
data set as it's apparent that for most of the clarity grades, the price range is 
not too different for most of the diamonds recorded. It is noted that there is still 
a slight difference between groups of grades. The same can be said for the difference 
between prices in terms of color grade. Visually, there seems to be an 
insignificant difference, but it's recommended to analyse these two variables more.

These observations about the relationship between the 4Cs and price is supported by our 
analysis. Information about the data set and how each visualization was made, along 
with thet appropiate in-depth analysis can be found in section 2 of this report.

# Section 2: Data Description and Visualization 
## About: Carat
The carat refers to the *weight* of the diamond, not the *size* of the diamond. 
Larger diamonds are sourced from larger crystals, meaning it's relatively harder 
to find than smaller crystals. Therefore, the price of a large carat diamond depends 
on how rare the larger crystals are. This would suggest that the larger the carat is, 
the more expensive the diamond is. In our data set, the variable name is *carat*.

## About: Clarity 
For clarity, diamonds are grouped into 11 different clarity grades, ranging from 
low (Included -I1,I2,I3- Diamonds) to high (Flawless -FL- Diamonds) grade. Clarity 
refers to how many 'inclusions' are within a diamond as the more inclusions a diamond 
has, the more negatively it affects the beauty of the diamond. In our data set, the 
variable name is *clarity*.

## About: Colour 
Color refers to how colourless a diamond is. There are 8 color grades for diamonds, 
ranging from low (K) to high (D) grade that are offered at **Blue Nile**. The other 
lower grades (L to Z) are not offered at **Blue Nile**. Diamonds with higher ratings 
strive to be as colorless as possible, whereas diamonds with lower ratings tend to 
exhibit more noticeable hues as we progress along the color diamond scale chart. 
A colorless diamond appears transparent, while diamonds lower on the rating chart 
may exhibit a warm tint or hue. In our data set, the variable name is *color*.

## About: Cut 
The cut of a diamond refers to the light performance of a diamond. It is based on 
a combination of factors: proportions, symmetry, and polish (the overall surface 
condition of facets). There are four grades to the GIA scale for cut, ranging from 
"Poor/Fair" to "Excellent/Ideal". **Blue Nile** has their specialty "Super Ideal" 
ranking called *Astor*. **Blue Nile** does not sell poor/fair diamonds. In our data 
set, the variable name is *cut*.

## About: Price
The price is the dollar amount of each diamond in USD. For the most part of the 
visualizations, the price will either be reflected in thousands or log-thousands 
for easier comprehension/visualization. In our data set, the variable name is *price*. 

## Additional Information on Dataset Changes 
The analysis on the relationship between the predictor variables and response variables 
were done using R. The packages used were ggplot2, dplyr, and MASS for data wrangling 
and visualization. 

Due to the variables Clarity, Color, and Cut having a grade order, the variables 
were refactored using the factor() function in order to reflect the grades from 
lowest to highest when creating the graphs and visualizations.

## Graphs and Visualizations
```{r}
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=carat, y=price/1000))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Relationship Between The Carat Weight of Diamonds and the Price",
        x="Carat Weight",
        y="Price in Thousands (USD)",
        caption="Figure 1")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Refer to Figure 1. Generally, the price goes up when the carat goes up. The relationship 
between the carat weight and the price seem to follow a curvilinear trend, which 
suggests a transformation for the carat variable. The variance also seems to be 
increasing, suggesting a transformation for the price variable. This will be further 
discussed in section 3.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamond) + 
  aes(y = log(price/1000), x=clarity, size=carat, fill=clarity)+ 
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.8)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title='Log-Price of Diamonds by Clarity', 
  x="Level of Clarity",
  y='Log-Price in Thousands (USD)',
  caption="Figure 2.1")+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Figure 2.1 above more clearly displays the relationship between the log-price and clarity 
of diamonds. Observing the median further supports that the grade of clarity does 
not significantly change the price of the diamonds. Exceptions are noted for SI2 
and FL clarity grade diamonds.

```{r}
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=carat, y=price/1000, color=clarity))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~clarity)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Relationship Between The Carat Weight of Diamonds and the Price",
       subtitle="by Clarity Grade",
       x="Carat Weight",
       y="Price in Thousands (USD)",
       caption="Figure 2.2",
       color="Clarity Grade")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Figure 2.2 shows the relationship between carat weight and clarity grade. Mostly, the 
lower carat weight diamonds are around the same price range, regardless of clarity grade.
This graph further supports the observations concluded in Figure 2.1. It is currently 
unknown if the difference is statistically significant. Most of the different 
clarity grades in Figure 2.2 also seem to rise in price in a similar fashion as well 
since most of them seem to have a curvilinear relationship with price. The two 
Slightly Included grades and the Flawless grade are noted to be seemingly more different 
to the other 5 categories. 

A better visualization is shown below (Figure 2.3). 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamond) + 
  aes(y = carat, x=clarity, size=price/1000, color=clarity)+ 
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) + 
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title='Relationship Between Carat Weight and Clarity Grade',
       x='Level Clarity',
       y='Carat Weight',
       caption="Figure 2.3",
       size="Price in Thousands (USD)")+
  guides(color=FALSE)+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Figure 2.3 shows a clearer image of price increase when both the carat and the clarity 
increase. Although there are some slight outliers, which is likely due to the other 
variables given by **Blue Nile**.

Please note that while **Blue Nile** does offer a limited selection of preset 
jewelry with I1 diamonds, there were no records of Included Diamonds within this 
data set.

```{r}
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=clarity, fill= cut))+
  geom_bar(position='fill', color="black")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Level of Clarity", 
       y="Proportion of Cuts", 
       title="Proportion of Cuts Within Clarity Grades",
       caption="Figure 2.4",
       fill="Cut Grade")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Figure 2.4 above displays the relationship between the type of cuts and the levels 
of clarity. This shows that most of the cuts are ideal regardless of each level 
of clarity, meaning that there may not be a relationship between these two variables.

It is observed that for the highest two levels of clarity, there appears to be no 
diamonds with the Astor ideal cut. This is likely due to the rarity of the IF and 
FL level diamonds. Within the 1214 diamonds we were given data for, 49 were IF 
clarity and 3 were FL clarity. Regardless of the diamonds not having and Astor 
ideal cuts, they still make up the most expensive diamonds in the data set. 

```{r}
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=color2, y=log(price/1000), fill=color2))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_bw()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  labs(title="Log-Price of Diamonds by Color Grade",
       x="Color Grade",
       y="Log-Price in Thousands (USD)",
       caption="Figure 3.1")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

A log transformation was done on the price variable for a better view by taking 
the log of the price variable. The resulting graph, Figure 3.1, suggests that the color 
of the diamond does not significantly affect the price as the median seems to stay 
relatively constant throughout the different color grades. An exception may be noted 
with color grade I, but the difference may or may not be negligible.

Note that we do not have all the type of color in our data set.

```{r}
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=carat, y=price/1000, color=color2))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~color2)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Relationship Between The Carat Weight of Diamonds and the Price",
       subtitle="by Color Grade",
       x="Carat Weight",
       y="Price in Thousands (USD)",
       caption="Figure 3.2",
       color="Color Grade")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Refer to the graph labelled Figure 3.2. As shown by the graph, there seems to be a 
faster rise in price as color grade increases, but the difference may or may not be 
statistically significant. It also seems to be that as color grade increases in 
quality, the curvilinear trend becomes more prominent. A supplementary visual is 
provided with the same information (Figure 3.3).

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamond) + 
  aes(y = carat, x=color2, size=price/1000, color=color2)+ 
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) + 
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title='Relationship Between Carat Weight and Color Grade',
       x='Color Grade',
       y='Carat Weight',
       caption="Figure 3.3",
       size="Price in Thousands (USD)")+
  guides(color=FALSE)+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
```{r}
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=color2, fill= cut))+
  geom_bar(position='fill', color="black")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Color Grade", 
       y="Proportion of Cuts", 
       title="Proportion of Cuts Within Color Grades",
       caption="Figure 3.4",
       fill="Cut Grade")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The relationship between cut type and colour grade is shown in Figure 3.4. It is 
noted that there is not a significant difference cut type across color grade. This 
indicates that a relationship may not be present between these two variables.

```{r}
log_price<- log(diamond$price) #restores symmetry to data and reduces skewness
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=cut, y=log_price, fill=cut)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_bw()+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  labs(x="Cut Type", 
       y="Log-Price in Thousands (USD)", 
       title="Boxplot Representing Log-Price vs Cut of Blue Nile Diamonds",
       caption="Figure 4.1")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold")) #centering title
```

Figure 4.1 shows the summary statistics for the log-price to create 
a more visually effective boxplot. Judging by the figure, we can see that the IQR 
of prices of all cut types is about 7-9. Astor Ideal has the highest median out of 
the cut types, but the difference may or may not be negligible. Good and Very Good 
cuts have almost identical medians, but the Very Good cut has a larger range of prices 
and a much higher maximum price. Surprisingly, Ideal cuts have the biggest IQR and 
the first quartile of this box has the lowest starting point. 

```{r}
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=carat, y=price/1000, color=cut))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~cut)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Relationship Between The Carat Weight of Diamonds and the Price",
       subtitle="by Cut Grade",
       x="Carat Weight",
       y="Price in Thousands (USD)",
       caption="Figure 4.2",
       color="Cut Grade")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Figure 4.2 shows that Very Good and Ideal cuts seem to have a more curvilinear trend. 
But, similar to the overall conclusion drawn with the clarity and color variables, 
the difference might not be statistically significant. More testing needs to be done. 
In addition, As carat increases, price also increases for all diamond cut types. 
By observation, Good cut has the steepest slope. The highest prices belong to Very Good 
and Ideal cuts. According to the data set, Astor Ideal cuts usually have smaller 
carats and lower price, but **Blue Nile** has stated that their super-ideal Astor 
is the most expensive cut, which contradicts the observation. 

```{r}
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=cut, fill=color))+
  geom_bar(position="fill", color="black")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(y="Proportion",
       x="Cut Grade",
       title="Proportion of Color Grade Diamonds Within Cut Grade",
       caption="Figure 4.3",
       fill="Color Grade")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The relationship between cut and color was observed using a stacked bar graph (Figure 4.3). 
The highest quality color is considered 'D', and the lowest, 'J'. Overall, 
there doesn't seem to be too much difference in the colors of each cut. However, we 
can make the observation that Good cut has the largest proportion of D color, while 
Astor Ideal has the largest proportion of F color. When thinking about the price points of 
these cuts and the quality of colors, we know that Astor Ideal doesn't have a high 
price point, which is in line with the color quality. On the other hand, we know that 
Very Good and Ideal cuts have the highest prices, but this is not reflected in the 
colors that are used for these cuts. All colors seem to be used pretty evenly for 
both cuts, with no overwhelming use of any color to create an association with price. 
This suggests that there may not be a relationship between the two variables.

# Section 3: Simple Linear Regression for Price Against Carat Weight 
```{r}
result<-lm(price~carat, data=diamond)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(result)
mtext("Figure 5.1", side = 3, line = -1.5, outer = TRUE)
```

A simple linear regression analysis was done for the variable carat weight. However, 
as mentioned before and seen in the residual plots (see: Figure 5.1), the variance 
increases as the price (fitted values) increases and the regression line seems to 
either under- or over-estimate the price. This indicates that a transformation on 
the response variable (price) and possibly the predictor variable (carat) may be 
needed in order to successfully create a linear regression model.

```{r}
MASS::boxcox(result, lambda = seq(0, 0.5, 1/100))
mtext("Figure 5.2", side = 3, line = -3.5, outer = TRUE)
```

The boxcox function from the R package MASS was used to determine an appropriate 
transformation for the response variable (Figure 5.2).

```{r}
ystar<-log(diamond$price)
Data<-data.frame(diamond,ystar)
result.ystar<-lm(ystar~carat, data=diamond)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(result.ystar)
mtext("Figure 5.3", side = 3, line = -1.5, outer = TRUE)
```
```{r}
ggplot(diamond, aes(x=carat, y=ystar))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Relationship Between The Carat Weight of Diamonds and the Log-Price",
        x="Carat Weight",
        y="Log-Price in Thousands (USD)",
        caption="Figure 5.4")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Based on the results, a log transformation was done on the response variable and 
the residual plots were redrawn (Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3 shows that the variance 
has stablised. 

However, the scatter plot (Figure 5.4) still shows the log-price and carat weight 
relationship to be a curvilinear trend, indicating that a tranformation of the 
predictor variable (carat weight) is still needed. Based on the trend, a log 
transformation on the predictor variable was done.

```{r}
xstar<-log(Data$carat)
Data<-data.frame(Data,xstar)
result.xstar<-lm(ystar~xstar, data=Data)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(result.xstar)
mtext("Figure 5.5", side = 3, line = -1.5, outer = TRUE)
```

Figure 5.5 ascertains that the assumptions for simple linear regression hold. The
data points are evenly distributed over the regression line, meaning the mean of 
the residuals for each fitted value is equal to zero, and the QQ plot shows the 
quantiles to be along the 45-degree angle, indicating that the distribution is 
normal. In addition, the variance over the horizontal band is fairly constant, as 
seen in the residual plot.

```{r}
ggplot(Data, aes(x=xstar, y=ystar))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  theme_bw()+
    labs(title="Relationship Between The Log-Carat Weight of Diamonds and the Log-Price",
        x="Log-Carat Weight",
        y="Log-Price in Thousands (USD)",
        caption="Figure 5.6")+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size=10, face="bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The final scatterplot (Figure 5.6) displaying the linear relationship between the 
carat weight and price of **Blue Nile** diamonds is shown.

With the regression analysis on the relationship between carat weight and diamond 
price complete, we can confirm that the two variables have a positive, linear 
relationship. This means that as for 1% increase in carat weight, the predicted 
price of a diamond by a certain value, provided that other possible influential 
variables are held constant.
